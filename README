Sections for S-75, Building Dynamic Websites

This directory contains Peter's latest examples
from section. To download this directory and keep up 
to sync with the examples, do this: 

cd ~/public_html
mkdir examples
chmod 711 examples
cd examples
git clone git://github.com/codekiln/S75-Sections.git

Git will download the latest update to the section
examples. Test to make sure it is working by opening
firefox in the appliance and going to:

http://localhost/~jharvard/examples/S75-Sections/opencyclemap/

For now, you will need to update the permissions to
the files on your own in order to get the examples
to work right. Doing this is left as an exercise to 
the reader.

In general you want these permissions: 
directories: 711
php files: 600
css, image files, and other public facing files: 644

To update to the latest version of the section
examples, change directory into the same directory 
that this README is in, then run: 

git pull

This will update to the latest version of the section
examples.
