Sections for S-75, Building Dynamic Websites

The examples from sections are available at
https://github.com/codekiln/S75-Sections. To download this
directory and keep the examples sync'd to your appliance, do
this: 

	cd ~/public_html 
	mkdir examples 
	chmod 711 examples 
	cd examples 
	git clone git://github.com/codekiln/S75-Sections.git

Git will then download the latest update to the section
examples. For now, the correct permissions are stripped from
the files and directories in git, so you will need to infer
the correct permissions and use the ls and chmod commands to
get the examples to display in your appliance. Doing this is
left as an exercise; the permissions should be the same as
for the assignments. Once the permissions are right, you can
test the examples by going to:

	http://localhost/~jharvard/examples/S75-Sections/opencyclemap/

To update to the latest version of the examples from
section, run:

	cd ~/public_html/examples git pull

This will update to the latest version of the section
examples.

In general you want these permissions: 
    directories: 711 
    php files: 600 
    css, image files, and other public facing files: 644

For the mysql examples, you will need to create the database
jharvard_example02 using phpmyadmin.
