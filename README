If this is your first time running examples in the CS50
Appliance, you'll need to set up your environment in the
command line: 

   cd ~ mkdir public_html chmod 711 public_html

To download the examples and keep them sync'd to your
appliance, enter each of these commands: 

   cd ~/public_html git clone
   git://github.com/codekiln/S75-Sections.git find
   ~/public_html -type d -print0 | xargs -0 chmod 755

Git will then download the latest update to the section
examples.  you may need to infer the correct permissions
and use the ls and chmod commands to get the examples to
display in your appliance.  Once the permissions are
right, you can see the examples by going to:

   http://localhost/~jharvard/examples/S75-Sections/

To update to the latest version of the examples from
section:

   cd ~/public_html/S75-Sections git pull

This will update to the latest version of the section
examples.

In general you want these permissions: directories: 711
php files: 600 css, image files, and other public facing
files: 644

For the mysql examples, you will need to create the
database jharvard_example02 using phpmyadmin.

The example source code will look best in vim if you

   cd ~/public_html/S75-Sections cp .vimrc ~
